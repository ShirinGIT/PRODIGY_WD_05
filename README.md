# PRODIGY_WD_05
Weather App

This is TASK 4 of my internship at #ProdigyInfoTech.

I have built a web page that fetches weather data from a weather API based on the user's location or a user-inputted location. It also displays the current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant information.
